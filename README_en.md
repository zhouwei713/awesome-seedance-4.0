🎉 Welcome to the curated collection of images generated by GPT-4o!

This repo gathers striking examples produced by OpenAI's newest multimodal model, GPT‑4o.

Most examples come from Twitter/X 🐦. May they spark ideas 💡 and turbo‑charge your creativity 🚀.

OpenAI’s latest cutting-edge image model, **gpt-image-1**, has been released, offering even more powerful image generation capabilities and is available via API.

<strong>Check out the 40+ brilliant examples below, carefully curated and translated by this project, sourced from OpenAI official materials, showcasing the power of `gpt-image-1`! 👇</strong>

-   Chinese Version: [OpenAI gpt-image-1: 40 Curated Prompt & Image Examples (Chinese)](./gpt-image-1/gpt-image-1.md)
-   English Version: [OpenAI gpt-image-1: 40 Curated Prompt & Image Examples](./gpt-image-1/gpt-image-1-en.md)

*Note: Both `gpt-image-1` and GPT-4o are OpenAI's latest image generation products, supported by largely the same underlying models. The main difference is that the former is currently accessed via API, while the latter powers official products like ChatGPT and Sora. `gpt-image-1` represents the newer iteration available through the API.*

<img src="./examples/example_anime_nostalgic_poster.png" width="300" alt="nostalgic anime film poster in High School DXD style with folds and scuffing damage">

**Prompt:**
```
{The Lord of the Rings} anime film poster, the anime is in the style of High School DXD. Visible even folds are seen across the poster as it’s been folded over time, and due to some creases over damaging the poster has caused some physical damage scuffing along the creases and the color has partially faded. Indiscriminate flaps and folds and scratches all around simply from moving back and forth causing subtle yet incremental damage with the ever expanding of entropy we cannot escape, but the loving memories in our hearts will forever be whole. Making the objects we collect along the way priceless is the essence you feel when looking at this nostalgic poster.
```

*Note: You can replace the movie title "{The Lord of the Rings}" in the prompt with others. Be aware that some movie titles may trigger content moderation. The referenced anime style can also be modified.*

**Prompt:**
```
{
    "prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",

The scene is set in a dim and cluttered bedroom from the year 2008. The character is sitting on the carpet, facing an old-fashioned television that is playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 and a game console controller.
The entire room is filled with a nostalgic atmosphere of the year 2008: snack packaging bags, soda cans, posters, and tangled wires are everywhere. Natasha Volkova is captured in the moment of turning her head, looking back at the camera over her shoulder. There is an innocent smile on her iconic ethereally beautiful face. Her upper body is slightly twisted, with a natural dynamic, as if she is reacting to being startled by the flash.
The flash slightly overexposes her face and clothes, making her silhouette stand out more prominently in the dimly lit room. The whole photo appears raw and natural. The strong contrast between light and dark casts deep shadows behind her. The image is full of tactile feel, with a simulated texture that resembles an authentic film snapshot from 2008.

Please draw an extremely ordinary iPhone selfie, lacking a clear subject or sense of composition, like a snapshot taken casually. The photo has slight motion blur, and uneven sunlight or indoor lighting causes slight overexposure. The angle is awkward, the composition is chaotic, presenting an overall sense of deliberate mediocrity - like a selfie accidentally taken while pulling the phone out of a pocket. The subjects are Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse, at night, next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, beside Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.

Place it on a clean, minimal background (light gray or pale blue), and maintain a playful, sculptural aesthetic.

Include the word "ARRIVAL" and a fictional date like "15 APR 2025" Incorporate a subtle silhouette of {Main Landmark} as a background detail within the stamp. Use deep blue or red ink with light smudges for added realism. The stamp should appear slightly angled, as if hand-pressed. The passport page should show visible paper texture and security patterns.
```

*Note: You can replace the city, country, landmark, and date placeholders. The example image uses "Rome", "Italy", "Colosseum", and "13 APR 2025" (date differs slightly from the base prompt structure).*

**Prompt:**
```
A hyper-realistic, cinematic illustration depicting Lara Croft dynamically crashing through the border of an "Archaeological Expeditions" trading card. She is mid-leap or swinging on a rope, clad in iconic adventure gear, possibly firing dual pistols with muzzle flares helping to shatter the card's ancient stone-carved border, creating visible dimensional break effects around the breach like energy cracks and spatial distortion, sending dust and debris flying. Her body bursts forward energetically with significant motion depth, breaking the card's plane, while the card interior (background) depicts a lush jungle ruin or trap-filled tomb interior. Card debris mixes with crumbling stone, flying vines, ancient coin fragments, and spent bullet casings. The title "ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPEDITIONS" and the name "LARA CROFT" (with a stylized artifact icon) are visible on the remaining cracked and weathered parts of the card. Adventurous, dynamic lighting highlights her athleticism and the perilous environment.

**Prompt:**
```
A hyper-realistic isometric 3D render of a miniature computer setup inside a translucent mechanical keyboard keycap, specifically placed on the ESC key of a real matte-finished mechanical keyboard. Inside the keycap, a tiny figure sits in a modern ergonomic chair, wearing a cozy textured hoodie, working at a glowing ultra-realistic computer screen. The environment is packed with lifelike miniature tech accessories: real-material desk lamps, monitors with reflections, tiny speaker grills, tangled cables, and ceramic mugs. The base of the scene is made of soil, rocks, and moss, with photorealistic textures and imperfections. The lighting inside the cap mimics natural morning sun, casting soft shadows and warm tones, while the outside has cold ambient reflections from the surrounding keyboard. The word “ESC” is subtly etched onto the top of the translucent keycap with a faint frosted glass effect — just barely visible depending on the angle. The surrounding keyboard keys like F1, Q, Shift, and CTRL are crisp, textured, and photorealistically lit. Shot as if taken with a high-end mobile phone camera, with shallow depth of field, perfect white balance, and cinematic detail.

<img src="./examples/example_lego_collectible.jpeg" width="300" alt="Lego figure resembling the user with a matching animal companion in a display case">

**Prompt:**
```
根据我上传的照片，生成一张纵向比例的照片，使用以下提示词：

经典乐高人偶风格，一个微缩场景 —— 一只动物站在我身旁。这只动物的配色与我相匹配。

请根据你对我的理解来创造这只动物（你可以选择任何你认为适合我的动物，不论是真实存在的，还是超现实的、幻想的，只要你觉得符合我的气质即可）。

整个场景设定在一个透明玻璃立方体内，布景极简。

微缩场景的底座是哑光黑色，配以银色装饰，风格简约且时尚。

底座上有一块优雅雕刻的标签牌，字体为精致的衬线体，上面写着该动物的名称。

底部设计中还巧妙融入了类似自然历史博物馆展示的生物学分类信息，以精细蚀刻的方式呈现。

整体构图像是一件高端收藏艺术品：精心打造、策展般呈现、灯光细致。

构图重在平衡。背景为渐变色，从深色到浅色过渡（颜色基于主色调进行选择）。
