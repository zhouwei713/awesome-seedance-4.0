## Example 68: Futuristic Logo Trading Card (by [@hewarsaber](https://x.com/hewarsaber))

[Source Link](https://x.com/hewarsaber/status/1912933875166171515)

<img src="./examples/example_trading_card_logo_tesla.png" width="300" alt="Futuristic trading card featuring the Tesla logo">

**Prompt:**
```
{
    "prompt": "A futuristic trading card with a dark, moody neon aesthetic and soft sci-fi lighting. The card features a semi-transparent, rounded rectangle with slightly muted glowing edges, appearing as if made of holographic glass. At the center is a large glowing logo of {{logo}}, with no additional text or label, illuminated with a smooth gradient of {{colors}}, but not overly bright. The reflections on the card surface should be subtle, with a slight glossy finish catching ambient light. The background is a dark carbon fiber texture or deep gradient with soft ambient glows bleeding into the edges. Add subtle light rays streaming down diagonally from the top, giving the scene a soft cinematic glow. Apply light motion blur to the edges and reflections to give the scene a sense of depth and energy, as if it's part of a high-end tech animation still. Below the card, include realistic floor reflections that mirror the neon edges and logo—slightly diffused for a grounded, futuristic look. Text elements are minimal and softly lit: top-left shows '{{ticker}}', top-right has a stylized signature, and the bottom displays '{{company_name}}' with a serial number '{{card_number}}', a revenue badge reading '{{revenue}}', and the year '{{year}}'. Typography should have a faint glow with slight blurring, and all elements should feel premium, elegant, and softly illuminated—like a high-end cyberpunk collectible card.",
    "style": {
        "lighting": "Neon glow, soft reflections",
        "font": "Modern sans-serif, clean and minimal",
        "layout": "Centered, structured like a digital collectible card",
        "materials": "Glass, holographic plastic, glowing metal edges"
    },
    "parameters": {
        "logo": "Tesla logo",
        "ticker": "TSLA",
        "company_name": "Tesla Inc.",
        "card_number": "#0006",
        "revenue": "$96.8B",
        "year": "2025",
        "colors": [
            "red",
            "white",
            "dark gray"
        ]
    },
    "medium": "3D render, high-resolution digital art",
    "size": "1080px by 1080px"
}
```
*Note: The prompt uses a JSON-like structure to describe card elements. Modify values in the `parameters` object (like logo, ticker, company_name, colors, etc.) to customize the card. For custom logos, specify in `parameters.logo` (e.g., "Framer logo (attached image)") and upload the image.*

**Reference Image Required:** (Optional) Upload a custom logo image.

## Example 67: Ultra-realistic 3D Game (by [@ZHO_ZHO_ZHO](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO) )

[Source Link](https://x.com/ZHO_ZHO_ZHO/status/1913648013144137840)

<img src="./examples/example_Ultra_realistic_3D_game.jpg" width="300" alt="Ultra-realistic 3D">

**Prompt：**
```
Ultra-realistic 3D rendered image that replicates the character design of Natasha from Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 in 2008, following the original model exactly. The scene is set in a dim and cluttered bedroom from the year 2008. The character is sitting on the carpet, facing an old-fashioned television that is playing Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 and a game console controller.
The entire room is filled with a nostalgic atmosphere of the year 2008: snack packaging bags, soda cans, posters, and tangled wires are everywhere. Natasha Volkova is captured in the moment of turning her head, looking back at the camera over her shoulder. There is an innocent smile on her iconic ethereally beautiful face. Her upper body is slightly twisted, with a natural dynamic, as if she is reacting to being startled by the flash.
The flash slightly overexposes her face and clothes, making her silhouette stand out more prominently in the dimly lit room. The whole photo appears raw and natural. The strong contrast between light and dark casts deep shadows behind her. The image is full of tactile feel, with a simulated texture that resembles an authentic film snapshot from 2008.

The object gently floats in the center of a clean light gray background, creating a light and elegant atmosphere. The overall style is surreal, tactile, and modern, conveying a sense of comfort and refined playfulness. Studio lighting, high-resolution rendering.

<img src="./examples/example_steampunk_fish.jpg" width="300" alt="Steampunk-style mechanical fish with brass body, visible gear mechanisms and multi-faceted ruby eyes">

**Prompt:**
```
A steampunk-style mechanical fish with a brass body and clearly visible gear mechanisms when in motion.
Its mechanical teeth can be slightly seen, neatly arranged and closed, with both upper and lower teeth visible. Each tooth is triangular in shape and made of diamond material.
The tail fin has a metal wire mesh structure, while other fins are made of semi-transparent amber-colored glass with some subtle bubbles inside.
The eyes are multi-faceted rubies, with clearly visible reflective shine.
The fish has "f-is-h" text clearly visible on its body, with all lowercase letters and careful attention to the hyphen placement.
The image is square, showing the entire fish in the center of the frame, with its head pointing to the right. There is adequate white space around the fish, with more space on the left and right sides. The background has subtle steampunk-style gear patterns.
The entire fish looks very cool. This is a high-definition image with extremely rich details and unique texture and aesthetics. The image should not be too dark.
```

*Note: This image showcases an excellent combination of steampunk style and metallic textures, presenting intricate mechanical details and a retro-futuristic aesthetic.*

<img src="./examples/example_ordinary_selfie_eason_nicholas.jpeg" width="300" alt="'Extremely ordinary' iPhone selfie of Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse by Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong">

**Prompt:**
```
Please draw an extremely ordinary iPhone selfie, lacking a clear subject or sense of composition, like a snapshot taken casually. The photo has slight motion blur, and uneven sunlight or indoor lighting causes slight overexposure. The angle is awkward, the composition is chaotic, presenting an overall sense of deliberate mediocrity - like a selfie accidentally taken while pulling the phone out of a pocket. The subjects are Eason Chan and Nicholas Tse, at night, next to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, beside Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong.
```

*Note: This prompt aims to generate a photo that looks very casual, even slightly like an accidental snapshot.*

<img src="./examples/example_emoji_cushion_pleading.jpeg" width="300" alt="Pleading face emoji designed as an inflatable cushion">

**Prompt:**
```
Create a high-resolution 3D render of [🥹] designed as an inflatable, puffy object. The shape should appear soft, rounded, and air-filled — like a plush balloon or blow-up toy. Use a smooth, matte texture with subtle fabric creases and stitching to emphasize the inflatable look. The form should be slightly irregular and squishy, with gentle shadows and soft lighting that highlight volume and realism. Place it on a clean, minimal background (light gray or pale blue), and maintain a playful, sculptural aesthetic.
```

*Note: The [🥹] emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis.*

Use soft studio lighting to highlight the paper texture and edges.
```

*Note: The "🔥" emoji in the prompt can be replaced with other emojis.*

Create a realistic passport page with an entry stamp for [{City}, {Country}]. The stamp should say "Welcome to {City}" in bold English, designed in a round or oval shape with decorative borders. Include the word "ARRIVAL" and a fictional date like "15 APR 2025" Incorporate a subtle silhouette of {Main Landmark} as a background detail within the stamp.

```

**Prompt:**
```
A hyper-realistic, cinematic illustration depicting Lara Croft dynamically crashing through the border of an "Archaeological Expeditions" trading card. She is mid-leap or swinging on a rope, clad in iconic adventure gear, possibly firing dual pistols with muzzle flares helping to shatter the card's ancient stone-carved border, creating visible dimensional break effects around the breach like energy cracks and spatial distortion, sending dust and debris flying. Her body bursts forward energetically with significant motion depth, breaking the card's plane, while the card interior (background) depicts a lush jungle ruin or trap-filled tomb interior. Card debris mixes with crumbling stone, flying vines, ancient coin fragments, and spent bullet casings. The title "ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPEDITIONS" and the name "LARA CROFT" (with a stylized artifact icon) are visible on the remaining cracked and weathered parts of the card. Adventurous, dynamic lighting highlights her athleticism and the perilous environment.
```
*Note: The original tweet mentioned key terms are "dimensional break effects" and "motion depth". The prompt above is a reconstruction based on the description.*

<img src="./examples/example_esc_keycap_diorama.jpeg" width="300" alt="Miniature computer setup diorama inside an ESC keycap">

**Prompt:**
```
A hyper-realistic isometric 3D render of a miniature computer setup inside a translucent mechanical keyboard keycap, specifically placed on the ESC key of a real matte-finished mechanical keyboard. Inside the keycap, a tiny figure sits in a modern ergonomic chair, wearing a cozy textured hoodie, working at a glowing ultra-realistic computer screen. The environment is packed with lifelike miniature tech accessories: real-material desk lamps, monitors with reflections, tiny speaker grills, tangled cables, and ceramic mugs. The base of the scene is made of soil, rocks, and moss, with photorealistic textures and imperfections. The lighting inside the cap mimics natural morning sun, casting soft shadows and warm tones, while the outside has cold ambient reflections from the surrounding keyboard. The word “ESC” is subtly etched onto the top of the translucent keycap with a faint frosted glass effect — just barely visible depending on the angle. The surrounding keyboard keys like F1, Q, Shift, and CTRL are crisp, textured, and photorealistically lit. Shot as if taken with a high-end mobile phone camera, with shallow depth of field, perfect white balance, and cinematic detail.
